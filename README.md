The user stories requirements can be found below:

1. My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements.
2. I should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. I should see a `div` element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`.
4. Within the `img-div` element, I should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`.
5. Within the `img-div` element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`.
6. I should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. I should see an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`).
8. The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
9. The `img` element should be centered within its parent element
